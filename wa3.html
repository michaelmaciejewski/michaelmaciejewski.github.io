<hr>
	<p><b> by Michael Maciejewski </b></p>

	<p>The financial market recently saw a historic fluctuation as Gamestop’s stocks were being manipulated by individual investors who used social media to trick big institutional investors. The pandemic has caused many people to get involved with day trading by using platforms such as Robinhood. This fluctuation is so monumental because the market has never seen individual investors collaborate on a platform to impact a specific stock against Wall Street Companies. Gamestop’s business operations were halted due to the pandemic which caused them to close stores. Therefore, it was inevitable that this company was going to begin to fail as no more customers were shopping in stores.</p>

	<p>The reddit community or more specifically the page <b>/rWallStreetBets</b> collectively drove up the stock's price creating a short squeeze eventually forcing big investors and hedge funds to lose a lot of money. The community’s intention was to protect retail investors from big investors on Wall Street. During the dramatic increase of Gamestops stock price, Robinhood decided to block users from trading shares after recognizing the impact on the market. However, there is further speculation of a conflict of interest due to the company's relationship with certain hedge funds. This has been put into question by lawmakers and politicians whether this decision to block trading was violating rights of individual investors.</p>

     
	<p>The policies need to govern the actors and organizations who participate in the market therefore, change needs to be highlighted in the wake of such an event. The problem occured when Robinhood shut down its platform, disabling individual investors from the market while large investors on wall street could continue to trade the stock. Lawmakers on both sides of the political party were outraged by Robinhood’s decision and it highlighted the need for transparency in such a new system of power. The unethical conduct contradicts the free market which Robinhood stands to fight for against big investors thus making the situation even more skeptical. There needs to be policies that protect individual investors as financial companies should not be allowed to manipulate a market. This highlights an unjust system at work that allows large companies to benefit while individual investors suffer. </p>

	<p>The monitorization of a volatile market will allow regulations to be enforced and market participants to be held accountable. This will allow the market to be more fair as there will be a deep concentration on online trading, short selling, and social media. If regulations like this were in place before this might of crisis might have not happened, as financial investors were obviously trying to take advantage of Gamestops decreasing sales.</p>

	<p>Moreover, I think social media was a powerful platform in this situation and highlights the importance of it being a place for free speech. There should be no limitations to social platforms as most times the movements brought about expose unjust systems. It is important that officials re-evaluate the stock market so that there is an equal opportunity for distribution and trading. The important thing to highlight on the political side is that both democrat and republicans agree on the priority of concern regarding the volatility of the market. It’s most interesting to see how the collaborative effort of a reddit page caused financial damage to investors who thought they could take advantage.</p>
