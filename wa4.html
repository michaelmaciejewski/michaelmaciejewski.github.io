	<p><b>By: Michael Maciejewski</b></p>
	<hr>
	<p>Individuals gravitate towards heightened emotions in television shows. The comedic show <q>The Office</q> represents this in season 5 episode 14, by turning a stressful situation into a hilarious exaggeration. Out of all <q>The Office</q> episodes this one in particular was most watched by its beloved viewers. Although it is not the highest rated episode, viewers continually refer back to this specific comedic explosion. The episode, <q>Stress Relief</q> makes a joke of how humans would react to an intentional arson.</p>
	<p>This differentiates from other episodes by providing more complex actions and camera shots of the events occuring. The high intensity of the situation keeps the viewer entertained and engaged while they await a solution.</p>
	<p>Based on the datasets from the Office it is evident that the <q>Stress Relief</q> Episode has been watched almost double the amount of times from other episodes watched. This motivates the assumption that viewers are likely to refer back to episodes with high intensity
	</p>
	<p>Moreover, the episodes containing less dramatic occurrences are likely to be looked over. Given that the <q>Pilot</q> Episode was primarily developing the premise of the show it did not contain high intensity scenes, therefore it was more skipped past more often than other episodes.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to being the most viewed episode, <q>Stress Relief</q> is rated the second best episode in the series following behind the <q>Finale</q>. Given the heightened emotion of the shows ending this furthermore supports the claim that individuals gravitate towards heightened emotions in television shows.</p>
