				<h4 style="padding-top:2%"> Ways of Displaying Information </h4>
				<br>
		<p class ="container"> Information Science opens the possibility to reimage how humans communicate data. Data is represented in a number of different ways and during this class I have learned diverse methods of approach when visualizing data. The three main audienceâ€™s I am presenting a TV argument to are TV executives, TV fans/customers, and data scientists. The first audience, TV executives are going to be interested in a holistic understanding of something that includes reasoning and justification. Therefore, I think using RevealJS would be most effective in presenting information as it offers a diverse range of options for flowing through data. Using RevealJS I would include key points, findings, and conclusions. Furthermore while TV executives might not be interested in all the code behind a certain visualization, RevealJS allows clean, snippets of code to be displayed which will be helpful in allowing people to understand certain methods. This platform offers interactive features which allows viewers to access links and explore visualizations even further making it one of the most persuasive tools.

		<p class ="container">The resource I would use to present a TV argument to Data Scientist would be Jupyter Notebook. This platform is more technically-oriented therefore, it allows data scientists to explore and advance code. When looking into a jupyter notebook this particular audience can make reasoning of specific variables declared or operations used. Furthermore, this platform allows you to make visualizations effectively by offering extensions to other libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. For example, a data scientist might be interested in seeing how you read or sorted a certain api or dataset. Moreover, it allows code to run cell by cell making debugging most flexible and suitable. The possiblities are endless with these notebooks as it's structure offers the most computational explanation for your data analysis. Juypter is perfect for offering details about certain operations involved with the findings you discovered.

		<p class ="container">To present my argument about a TV show to TV fans and customers I would use a HTML page that uses Bootstrap and Vega Visualizations. This would be most accessible for this type of audience as it can be found on a web browser. Furthermore, the integration of Vega would allow an interactive component for people to visualize information. Vega Visualizations allows transformations and mutilation of datasets, making it particularly complex but also keeping it simple. The visualization tool is associated with the ability to aggregate different variables in data. Moreover, the particular interactive affordances such as tooltips will make the audience invested and interested in the visualization. Bootstrap would be used to format the website as this tool allows for professional, organized, and structured websites. Bootstrap allows for predefined classes and functions to be called making it easier than CSS. Affordances which makes Bootstrap a strong tool includes the ability to integrate responsive containers and interactive features in addition to being flexible across many devices. I would add particular animations and tools which allow the webpage to be visually pleasing and engaging. Its customization makes it the perfect choice for adapting to particular styling goals.
